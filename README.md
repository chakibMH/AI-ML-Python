# AI Notebooks Repository

This repository serves as a **personal archive** of Jupyter notebooks from my participation in various **AI challenges, hackathons, and AI events** where I contributed as a **speaker** (e.g., TAMARICS 22) and **trainer** (e.g., OpenData Datathon). 

## 📌 Purpose
Over time, I have accumulated numerous notebooks from these events. This repository acts as a **centralized storage**—a "grenier"—where I can easily revisit, reference, and reuse my work for future engagements.

## 📂 Repository Structure
The notebooks are organized into three main categories:
- **Workshops/** → Training sessions & technical tutorials
- **AI & Deep Learning/** → Advanced AI and deep learning projects
- **Algorithms & Python/** → Algorithmic implementations and Python-based solutions

## 🔍 How to Use
- Browse the relevant folder to find notebooks from specific events.
- Feel free to adapt and extend them for new projects or training sessions.
- Some notebooks may require additional dependencies—check the comments or `requirements.txt` if available.

## ✨ Future Additions
- Continuous updates with new notebooks from upcoming events.
- Additional documentation and improvements for easier reproducibility.
